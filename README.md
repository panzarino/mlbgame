mlbgame is a Python API to retrieve and read MLB GameDay data.
mlbgame works with real time data, getting information as games are being played.

mlbgame uses the same data that MLB GameDay uses,
and therefore is updated as soon as something happens in a game.

Examples
--------

Here is a quick teaser to find the scores of all home Mets games for the month of June, 2015:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import mlbgame

month = mlbgame.games(2015, 6, home='Mets')
games = mlbgame.combine_games(month)
for game in games:
    print(game)
```

And the output is:

    Giants (5) at Mets (0)
    Giants (8) at Mets (5)
    Giants (4) at Mets (5)
    Braves (3) at Mets (5)
    Braves (5) at Mets (3)
    Braves (8) at Mets (10)
    Blue Jays (3) at Mets (4)
    Blue Jays (2) at Mets (3)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (2) at Mets (7)
    Cubs (1) at Mets (0)

Maybe you want to know the pitchers for the Royals game on April 30th, 2015:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import mlbgame

day = mlbgame.day(2015, 4, 12, home='Royals', away='Royals')
game = day[0]
output = 'Winning pitcher: %s (%s) - Losing Pitcher: %s (%s)'
print(output % (game.w_pitcher, game.w_team, game.l_pitcher, game.l_team))
```

And the output is:

    Winning pitcher: Y. Ventura (Royals) - Losing Pitcher: C. Wilson (Angels)

You can easily find stats for the Mets batters
in the final game of the 2015 World Series:

```python
from __future__ import print_function
import mlbgame

game = mlbgame.day(2015, 11, 1, home='Mets')[0]
stats = mlbgame.player_stats(game.game_id)
for player in stats.home_batting:
    hr_rbi_output = '{0} - {1} for {2} with {3} RBI and {4} Home Runs'
    rbi_output = '{0} - {1} for {2} with {3} RBI'
    output = '{0} - {1} for {2}'
    if player.rbi > 0 and player.hr > 0:
        print(hr_rbi_output.format(player.name_display_first_last, player.h,
                                   player.ab, player.rbi, player.hr)
             )
    elif player.rbi > 0:
        print(rbi_output.format(player.name_display_first_last, player.h,
                                player.ab, player.rbi)
             )
    else:
        print(output.format(player.name_display_first_last, player.h, player.ab))
```

And the output is:

    Curtis Granderson - 1 for 4 with 1 RBI and 1 Home Runs
    David Wright - 1 for 5
    Daniel Murphy - 0 for 3
    Yoenis Cespedes - 0 for 3
    Juan Lagares - 0 for 2
    Lucas Duda - 0 for 2 with 1 RBI
    Travis d'Arnaud - 0 for 5
    Michael Conforto - 2 for 5
    Wilmer Flores - 0 for 4
    Matt Harvey - 0 for 3
    Jeurys Familia - 0 for 0
    Kelly Johnson - 0 for 1
    Jon Niese - 0 for 0
    Addison Reed - 0 for 0
    Bartolo Colon - 0 for 0
