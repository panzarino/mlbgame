"""mlbgame is a Python API to retrieve and read
MLB GameDay data.
mlbgame works with real time data, getting information as games are
being played.

mlbgame uses the same data that MLB GameDay uses,
and therefore is updated as soon as something happens in a game.

Installation
------------

mlbgame is in the [Python Package Index (PyPI)]
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mlbgame/).
Installing with `pip` is recommended for all systems.

mlbgame can be installed by running:

    pip install mlbgame

Alternatively, the latest release of mlbgame can be downloaded as a
[zip](https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame/archive/master.zip) or
[tarball](https://github.com/panzarino/mlbgame/archive/master.tar.gz).
If you do not install with `pip`, you must also install
`lmxl` as specified in `setup.py`.

If you want to help develop mlbgame,
you must also install the dev dependencies,
which can be done by running `pip install -e .[dev]`
from within the directory.

Examples
--------

Here is a quick teaser to find the scores of all home Mets games for the month
 of June, 2015:

    #!python
    from __future__ import print_function
    import mlbgame

    month = mlbgame.games(2015, 6, home='Mets')
    games = mlbgame.combine_games(month)
    for game in games:
        print(game)

And the output is:

    Giants (5) at Mets (0)
    Giants (8) at Mets (5)
    Giants (4) at Mets (5)
    Braves (3) at Mets (5)
    Braves (5) at Mets (3)
    Braves (8) at Mets (10)
    Blue Jays (3) at Mets (4)
    Blue Jays (2) at Mets (3)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (1) at Mets (2)
    Reds (2) at Mets (7)
    Cubs (1) at Mets (0)

Maybe you want to know the pitchers for the Royals game on April 30th, 2015:

    #!python
    from __future__ import print_function
    import mlbgame

    day = mlbgame.day(2015, 4, 12, home='Royals', away='Royals')
    game = day[0]
    output = 'Winning pitcher: %s (%s) - Losing Pitcher: %s (%s)'
    print(output % (game.w_pitcher, game.w_team, game.l_pitcher, game.l_team))

And the output is:

    Winning pitcher: Y. Ventura (Royals) - Losing Pitcher: C. Wilson (Angels)

You can easily print a list of the Mets batters
in the final game of the 2015 World Series:

    #!python
    from __future__ import print_function
    import mlbgame

    game = mlbgame.day(2015, 11, 1, home='Mets')[0]
    stats = mlbgame.player_stats(game.game_id)
    for player in stats.home_batting:
        print(player)

And the output is:

    Curtis Granderson (RF)
    David Wright (3B)
    Daniel Murphy (2B)
    Yoenis Cespedes (CF)
    Juan Lagares (CF)
    Lucas Duda (1B)
    Travis d'Arnaud (C)
    Michael Conforto (LF)
    Wilmer Flores (SS)
    Matt Harvey (P)
    Jeurys Familia (P)
    Kelly Johnson (PH)
    Jonathon Niese (P)
    Addison Reed (P)
    Bartolo Colon (P)
